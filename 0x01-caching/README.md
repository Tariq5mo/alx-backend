## Introduction

Caching is a technique used to improve data access speed by storing frequently accessed data temporarily. This project explores different caching strategies through practical implementations.

### Algorithms Covered

- **Basic Cache**: Unlimited storage, no eviction.
- **FIFO**: First In, First Out.
- **LIFO**: Last In, First Out.
- **LRU**: Least Recently Used.
- **MRU**: Most Recently Used.

**Objective**:
Design Python classes for each caching strategy while adhering to specific rules, including eviction policies when the cache exceeds its maximum size.

## Concepts and Skills

### Key Topics Covered

1. **Caching Systems**:
   - Understanding caching purpose and limitations.
   - Exploring real-world applications.

2. **Algorithm Development**:
   - Implementing caching policies with Python.
   - Managing evictions based on specified criteria.

3. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**:
   - Designing classes and methods for specific behaviors.
   - Using inheritance to extend functionality.

4. **Python Programming**:
   - Writing clean, efficient, and modular code.
   - Adhering to the **PEP 8 style guide**.

## Requirements

### General

- **Allowed editors**: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`.
- Code will be interpreted/compiled on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** using Python 3.7.
- Adhere to the **PEP 8 style guide** (version 2.5).
- No external module imports allowed.
- All files should:
  - End with a new line.
  - Be executable.
  - Include proper documentation for modules, classes, and functions.

### Repository Structure

- **GitHub repository**: [alx-backend](https://github.com/Tariq5mo/alx-backend)
- **Directory**: `0x01-caching`
- **Files**:
  - `base_caching.py`: Base class for all caching systems.
  - `0-basic_cache.py`: Basic caching with no eviction policy.
  - `1-fifo_cache.py`: FIFO caching.
  - `2-lifo_cache.py`: LIFO caching.
  - `3-lru_cache.py`: LRU caching.
  - `4-mru_cache.py`: MRU caching.

## Project Tasks

### **0. Basic Cache**

Create a class `BasicCache` that inherits from `BaseCaching`.
This caching system has no size limit and does not implement an eviction policy.

#### Methods

- `put(self, key, item)`:
  - Adds an item to the cache.
  - Does nothing if `key` or `item` is `None`.
- `get(self, key)`:
  - Retrieves an item by key or `None` if the key does not exist.

---

### **1. FIFO Caching**

Create a class `FIFOCache` that inherits from `BaseCaching`.
Implements the **FIFO (First In, First Out)** eviction policy when the cache exceeds its size limit.

#### Rules

- When the number of items exceeds `MAX_ITEMS`, discard the oldest entry.
- Print `DISCARD: <key>` for the discarded key.

---

### **2. LIFO Caching**

Create a class `LIFOCache` that inherits from `BaseCaching`.
Implements the **LIFO (Last In, First Out)** eviction policy when the cache exceeds its size limit.

#### Rules

- When the number of items exceeds `MAX_ITEMS`, discard the most recently added entry.
- Print `DISCARD: <key>` for the discarded key.

---

### **3. LRU Caching**

Create a class `LRUCache` that inherits from `BaseCaching`.
Implements the **LRU (Least Recently Used)** eviction policy.

#### Rules

- When the number of items exceeds `MAX_ITEMS`, discard the least recently used entry.
- Print `DISCARD: <key>` for the discarded key.

---

### **4. MRU Caching**

Create a class `MRUCache` that inherits from `BaseCaching`.
Implements the **MRU (Most Recently Used)** eviction policy.

#### Rules

- When the number of items exceeds `MAX_ITEMS`, discard the most recently used entry.
- Print `DISCARD: <key>` for the discarded key.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Tariq5mo/alx-backend.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd 0x01-caching
   ```

3. Run the example script for each caching system. For instance, to test FIFO:

   ```bash
   ./1-main.py
   ```
